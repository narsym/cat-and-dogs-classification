1. we download the data from the kaggle using kaggle.json
2. unzip the data.
3. import the necessary libraries
4. load the data into train and test lists using cv2 and tf.image
5. convert these train and test lists to tensorflow datsets
6. format the images in the datasets
7. make them into batches
8. then we do transfer learning with mobilenetv2
9. at the end of our base model we add 2 layers, one with 32 neurons and another with 1 neuron.
10. when trained for 15 epochs we get 95% accuracy.
11. but i have trained for 20 epochs to see if any there is any improvement.
